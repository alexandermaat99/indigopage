          At times poppy and polished, and other times, melancholic, Indigo
          Waves runs the gamut of saccharine, ’80s lo-fi nostalgia and dream
          pop. With catchy singles such as “Jerry Whiner” and “Can’t Let Go,”
          Indigo Waves reminds me of Wild Nothing but with a sound that lends
          itself to more rock rhythms. In between each upbeat single, richly
          sublime tracks serve as emotional palette cleansers, as in “Let Go,” a
          personal favorite of mine from the album that imparts a hopeful
          gloominess, and “Draynor Manor,” a synthy, instrumental track that
          encompasses the cassette-tape atmosphere of the entire album.
          Vocalist/guitarist Austin Oestreich has a way of emotively charging
          his simplistic vocal melodies that makes the slightly distorted vocals
          pop against the instrumental background. For me, “Thanks” highlights
          the interplay between the somber lyrics, Oestreich’s charming vocals
          and the upbeat guitar and synth melodies well. The highly danceable
          track features a chorus of “Oh yeah you’re falling asleep / Oh yeah
          you’re caught in a dream.” Similarly, the second track, “Symbols,”
          boosts the album’s tone with an ethereal soundscape that breaks into
          an upbeat rhythm and equally optimistic vocals. The dichotomy between
          the nostalgic dreaminess and the catchy pop elements sets each track
          of Indigo Waves apart from the rest. Don’t be surprised if you catch
          an ear worm or two—these songs will get stuck in your head. -Ali
